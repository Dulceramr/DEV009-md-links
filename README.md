## 1. Introduction 

Markdown is a lightweight markup languaje that allows users to write using simple text formatting, which is then converted to HTML for display on the web, it is very popular and used on many platforms that handle plain text such as GitHub, forums, blogs. etc. And itÂ´s very common to find several files in that format in any type of repository, one example would be the traditional README.md. 

This Markdown files usually contains links that sometimes are broken or are not valid, this problem make evident the need for a tool that can read the markdown files in order to identify the links and that allows an analysis of these data through certain statistics.

In this context, we have created this tool called "md-links", which is a library created with Node.js that allows the user to verify and report links found within Markdown format files.
